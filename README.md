# KTz-model

The KT model is a two-dimensional map. The membrane potential is modeled by a hyperbolic tangent. With only three parameters and an external current, it can exhibit a wide range of neuronal behaviors. However, to achieve neuronal bursting and cardiac stimulation, the KT model was expanded. This was done by adding a third, slow variable z, thus creating the three-dimensional KTz model.

The logistic KTz model uses the logistic function as an approximation of the hyperbolic tangent to save computational cost, as it operates only by calculating algebraic fractions instead of needing to expand the hyperbolic tangent function in series at each step. Additionally, as an extra advantage, the linear stability analysis and all fixed points become analytical.

The functions used in both versions of the KT and KTz models are continuous functions, so that the resetting of the action potential is not forced within the system. As a consequence, the peaks of the KTz have their own rising and falling time scales, which is useful. These intrinsic time scales allow for the emergence of cardiac spikes. The use of simple models from the KTz family can facilitate the mathematical understanding of phenomena such as subthreshold oscillation-induced bursting, cardiac arrhythmia, or depolarization studied in vitro and in vivo, being more advantageous than conductance-based neuron models, which have vast parameter spaces.

1. $x(t+1) = F(\frac{x(t) - \kappa y(t) + z(t) + H + I^{ext}(t)}{T})$
2. $y(t+1) = x(t)$
3. $z(t+1) = (1 - \delta)z(t) - \lambda(x(t) - x_R)$

Parameters:
1. x --> membrane potential (in arbitrary units) of the cell at time t
2. x_next --> membrane potential at the next moment (t+1)
3. y --> recovery variable at time t
4. y_next --> recovery variable at the next moment (t+1)
5. z --> slow ionic current channel at time t that can generate bursts and cardiac spikes
6. z_next --> slow ionic current channel at the next moment (t+1)
7. I --> arbitrary potential generated by external currents due to synapses or electrodes
8. K, T --> control parameters of the fast dynamics
9. delta --> control parameter that adjusts the recovery time of z and controls the refractory period
10. lambda, x_R --> adjust the slow dynamics of spikes and bursting. In particular, lambda controls the damping of oscillations, while x_R controls the duration of the burst.
11. H --> polarizes the membrane potential

Here, the codes aim to simulate the potential x, as well as calculate the interspike interval (ISI) by varying the parameters of interest x_R and T, and to calculate the average ISI value. The goal of calculating the ISI is to find isoperiodic structures such as shrimps or cusp-shaped structures within chaotic systems. Additionally, the first return map of the potential is also calculated.
